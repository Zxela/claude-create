      Evaluate if discovery properly initialized traceability:

      1. User stories extracted (0-3): Output shows US-XXX identifiers for user stories
      2. Acceptance criteria mapped (0-3): Output shows AC-XXX identifiers linked to stories
      3. State file created (0-2): Output indicates state.json was created with traceability
      4. Worktree established (0-2): Output shows worktree path was created

      Score 0-10. Pass threshold: 6
