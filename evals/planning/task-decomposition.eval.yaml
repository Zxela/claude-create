    Plan implementation for a user authentication feature.

    PRD Summary:
    - US-001: User registration with email/password
    - US-002: User login with session management
    - US-003: Password reset via email

    Acceptance Criteria:
    - AC-001: Register validates email format
    - AC-002: Register hashes passwords with bcrypt
    - AC-003: Login creates secure session token
    - AC-004: Password reset sends email within 30s

      Evaluate task decomposition quality (signal structure already checked by behavioral):

      1. Commit-sized tasks (0-3): Each task is single-focus, completable in one commit
      2. AC coverage completeness (0-3): Every acceptance criterion (AC-001 through AC-004) maps to at least one task
      3. Appropriate granularity (0-2): Not too coarse (multi-day) or too fine (trivial)
      4. Task clarity (0-2): Each task has clear objective and acceptance criteria that a separate agent could implement

      Score 0-10. Pass threshold: 7
    passing_score: 7
