# Credits & Inspiration

This plugin incorporates patterns and ideas from the following sources:

## Context Engineering

- **Agent Skills for Context Engineering** by [@muratcankoylan](https://github.com/muratcankoylan)
  - Repository: https://github.com/muratcankoylan/Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering
  - Patterns applied: Context isolation, observation masking, filesystem-as-memory, progressive disclosure

## Agent Skills Collections

- **VoltAgent Awesome Agent Skills**
  - Repository: https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-agent-skills
  - 200+ curated agent skills from official dev teams and community

## Research Findings Applied

- Model choice drives 80% of performance variance on complex tasks
- Tool outputs consume ~84% of context in typical agent trajectories
- "Telephone game" (multi-hop summarization) causes ~50% performance degradation
- Context isolation is the primary benefit of multi-agent architectures
